Homestory is a webapp for storing interested furniture items you plan on purchasing in the future or simply just want to keep tabs of.

You will be able to create an account, login and add furnitures to your respective rooms. 

The frontend is built with Javascript with custom CSS styling and Bootstrap for form styling. Animations were created using animejs library (https://animejs.com/).
